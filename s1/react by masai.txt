How to create React Element ?

In React, you can create elements using JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax or by using React's createElement method.
JSX is a more popular and convenient way to create React elements, 
but both approaches achieve the same result. Let me show you both methods:

import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, I am a React element created with JSX!</h1>;
};


## Here's the equivalent of the JSX example using createElement:

import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, I am a React element created with React.createElement!');
};
